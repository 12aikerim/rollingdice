    <p>
        This game is similar to Game One. You will keep your role (Player A or
        Player B) assigned to you previously and you will again be paired with
        another player randomly by the computer. You will not know the identity
        of the person with whom you are paired each round. Your task is again to
        make decisions as per your assigned role for {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds.</p>
        <p>
        In this game, you will have three strategies, instead of two. Player A
        can now move UP or MIDDLE or DOWN and Player B can move LEFT or
        CENTER or RIGHT. You will not be able to see the other player’s choice until
        you submit your choice and the other player will not see your choice. You
        will earn points in each round according to the following rules:
    </p>
    <p>A) If you are Player A you will move UP, MIDDLE or DOWN.</p>
         <ul>
        <li> If you move UP you will earn {{ Constants.firm_fully_comply}}.</li>
        <li>If you move MIDDLE, you will earn 0 or {{ Constants.firm_PL}} depending on Player B’s move.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class = "dashed">
        <li>If you move MIDDLE and Player B moves LEFT you will get 50 points (with 10% probability) or 0 points (with 90% probability),</li>
        <li>If you move MIDDLE and Player B moves CENTER or RIGHT,you will get {{ Constants.firm_PL}} </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If you move DOWN, you will earn {{ Constants.firm_NF}},  or {{ Constants.firm_NN}}  depending on Player B’s move.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>If you move DOWN and Player B moves LEFT you will get {{ Constants.firm_NF}} ,</li>
            <li>If you move DOWN and Player B moves CENTER you will get 60 points (with 50% probability) or 10 points (with 50% probability),</li>
            <li>If you move DOWN and Player B moves RIGHT you will get {{ Constants.firm_NN}}.</li>
        </ul>


     <p> B) If you are Player B you will move LEFT, CENTER or RIGHT.</p>
        <p>
     <ul>
        <li>If you move LEFT you will earn {{ Constants.insp_FI}} or loose 30 points  depending on Player A’s move.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class = "dashed">
        <li>If you move LEFT and Player A moves UP or DOWN, you will get {{ Constants.insp_FI}}</li>
        <li>If you move LEFT and Player A moves  MIDDLE, you will get 20 points(with 90% probability) or loose 30 points(with 10% probability).</li>
    </ul>

        <li>If you move CENTER, you will earn {{Constants.insp_FL}} or {{Constants.insp_PL}}  depending on Player B’s move.</li>
    </ul>
        <ul class = "dashed">
            <li> If you move CENTER and Player A moves UP you will get {{Constants.insp_FL}},</li>
            <li> If you move CENTER and Player A moves MIDDLE,you will get {{Constants.insp_PL}}</li>
            <li> If you move CENTER and Player A moves DOWN, you will get 50 points (with 50% probability) or 0 points (with 50% probability)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>If you move RIGHT, you will earn {{ Constants.insp_FN}} or {{Constants.insp_NN}} depending on Player A’s move.</li>
    </ul>
        <ul class = "dashed">
            <li>If you move RIGHT and Player A moves UP, you will get {{ Constants.insp_FN}} </li>
            <li>If you move RIGHT and Player A moves DOWN or MIDDLE, you will get {{Constants.insp_NN}}</li>
        </ul>
    <ul>

        <p>In the following table we summarize these rules.</p>
        <p>In each cell the number on the left indicates points for Player A and the number on the right
            indicates points for Player B.</p>
