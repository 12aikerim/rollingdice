            <p><strong>Ending The Experiment</strong></p>
            <p>You have played four games in a total of 120 rounds. The computer will now randomly pick one round from each game to calculate your final earnings.
                Your total earnings will be converted to cash at a rate of 5 cents per point and you will be paid this amount privately in cash.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Your total experiment payoff is {{ participant.payoff }}, which is equivalent to {{player.convert}} and 5$ participation fee.</p>
        <p> Before finishing the game please complete the survey on the next page</p>
            Thank you for your participation. </p>
